### Using system prompts
System prompts are the messages that are being sent to ChatGPT to set the behavior of the responses. System prompts can be activated by adding a Keyword at the start of the sentences. When no Keyword is found, the default system prompt will be used (see below).

By default the plugin contains the following system prompts:
|Keyword | System Prompt |
|---------|---------------|
|normal|You are an all-knowing AI bot.|
|short|You are an all-knowing AI bot. All your answers are short, to the point, and don't give any additional context.|
|long|You are an all-knowing AI bot. All your answers are in-depth and give both a step-by-step explanation how you came to that answer, as well as references to the resources you used.|

The different outputs for the prompt "Test" are as follows:
|Keyword| Output|
|--------|-------|
|normal|I'm here to help. How may I assist you with your test?|
|short|Passed.|
|long|As an all-knowing AI bot, when I receive the input "test," I determine whether you are asking me to provide a test-related response or evaluate my knowledge and capabilities. Here, your query is brief and ambiguous, but I will provide an example of how I process and respond to questions. Step 1: Analyze the input: I examine the key term "test" and search for relevant context or additional details to understand your intention. Step 2: Generate a response: Based on your input, I try to cover the evident possibilities in my reply, thus accommodating your potential purpose. This includes testing my understanding, problem-solving capabilities, or demonstrating my knowledge on a specific topic. Step 3: Retrieve relevant resources: Since you did not provide specific details with your query, I cannot include references or resources that support my response. However, a more contextually-rich question will allow me to conduct comprehensive research and cite appropriate resources If you can provide additional information or clarify the context for your query, I will be able to generate an in-depth response based on your request. 

## Adding your own system prompts
You can add your own prompts in the following way:
1. Open Flow Launcher.
2. Type `Settings`.
3. Go to Plugins -> ChatGPT.
4. Click the small folder icon.
5. In the folder that opens, open `system_messages.csv`.
6. In the first column, add a new Keyword (without spaces).
7. In the second column, add the System Prompt that you would like to trigger with that Keyword.
8. Save the file.
