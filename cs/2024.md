This year i had this espectations about it but at the end i am going to end up well so here i go
i wanned to reach a goal that i've been trying to get for a long time becoming a real programmer not just saying you know about it that i can tell someone that i am a programmer
i started the year seeing a youtubet very good at doing videos and learning [ProyectMaria](https://www.youtube.com/@pr0jectmaria) and i got motivated by her and i started doing things like [[clases/cs50|cs50]] and cloning some c proyects to see what's inside of them just for curiosity, then i started to use [[Testing Obsidian]] and realize that the md extension file is on reality a [[markdown]] file that is a text format on plain text that almost every message app uses and I havent been doing well this year its not just the year its that i have been realizing a lot of things i might be autistic or part of the ASD[]
