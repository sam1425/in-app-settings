i would like very much to live in a small hole in the ground like a mole a small hole for an even smaller mole maybe dug into the side of a hill and i will close off the entrance to keep out the chill of the winters, heat of the summers no one would know, but please tell my mother i’m sorry, i’m sorry but it had to be done because when you can’t run from the invisible weight of the world teetering on your shoulder blades just smother yourself with dirt bury yourself alive so at least then you know where the suffocation is coming from because when i can feel my stomach being pulled out through my lips and forced back down again whenever its decided so i’d at least like to know who’s responsible so i can thank them for giving me a gag reflex crafted from steel and the artistry to construct a creative, well-rounded list of a thousand and one ways i could die i’ve learned that when fire and ice combine they don’t divide, they multiply two extremes don’t cancel they intensify and yes there’s something bringing the cold but oh i bring the burn if i was a mole in the side of a hill i wouldn’t seek that same masochistic thrill that keeps my human heart humming human mind numbing someone please help me, i think i’m becoming insignificant again that’s the third time today a mole wouldn’t cry when asked of its day when i was little i was told i had an excellent imagination who ever would have guessed i’d use it in the creation of my own personal hell where everything’s my fault and no matter how small i get i always take up too much space while at the same time taking up no space because have you ever thought about how big space is everyone’s so small but i’m the biggest small of them all not if i was a mole in the side of a hill with neither the heat nor the chill it’s quiet and cosy but really, that’s silly and i don’t suppose we could come to some sort of agreement for there’s lives to be lived business to conduct there’s moments to experience and there’s nothing to discuss things to think too much everything to think too much i always think too much
3Pain theory  
The story of the masochist’s daughter  
only ever had one ending. Under the nail  
skin unravels like a secret  
orange peel. A blood blister  
yawns awake on her trigger finger.  
She learns to lucid dream so she can die  
and not die. She is not afraid of knives  
or bad news. Not the plane crash. Not putrid  
water fear-chopped through the throat.  
Pain is the answer to a question  
her life is gathering the words to ask.  
The punchline is that when she grows up  
she becomes a lover, an acrobat who each perverted  
sunrise jumps from an unsurvivable height  
certain she can talk some sense into the fall.  
There’s a line between pain and pleasure  
as much as there’s a line between two eternities  
and anyway, this could be worse. The air  
is giving you one billion breathless kisse
