internet: for me the internet its just computers interconected among them it could be the cables but it is not just that
there is services that help with search and finding this computers conected like dns because people wont remember 192.168.1.1

packet: i think packets are chuncks of data for transfering between devices to make it easier to send and read and can even make
it faster compressing it and because of internet trafic would take longer and would be inestable

differences:

web page: it is what the browser displays when read multiple files programmed by a person html,css,js or ts and it is displayed on 
the screen

web server: is a computer that have the files to represent on the screen html,css,js and for every request send those files for a 
browser to be displayed

web browser: its just a program for displaying the files the web server gives you 


search engine: is a service that helps finding websites by typing words in the query and they are ranked so they always give the 
best options (by their criteria) 

client: any device conected to the cable(internet) that sends a request to any server

server: is a computer programmed so when requested sends information all over 

ip: is a number given to your especific device to localize you and no anybody else (given by your routers through the cable)
